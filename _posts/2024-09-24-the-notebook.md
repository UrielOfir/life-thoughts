At the core of my current worldview is the understanding that the world we live in is random and without divine planning; it is a product of chance, not a guiding hand. Therefore, I believe that the meaning of life is not something we receive, but something we create. It is a human creation, a shared project of humanity and of every individual, in which we build our values and purpose with our own hands.

What do we do in this situation? In my opinion, the answer is not in searching for the one "correct path," as there is no such thing. Instead, it is about understanding the reality we live in and trying to get the most out of it. The path to a better life is through a deep understanding of the challenges and opportunities before us. Our role is to learn about our soul, our body, and to manage our time and resources wisely, to avoid actions that harm us. Instead of saying what is right to do, we need to learn what can benefit us, and invest in that to make our lives happier and more fulfilling.

The Foundation for a Good Life: Body, Finance, and What's Between Them
So, how do we learn? The first step is to recognize that there is no divine "instruction manual," but that knowledge is a collection of insights, experiments, and conclusions that humanity has accumulated over the generations. Learning is not just limited to theoretical study; it is a continuous journey of self-exploration: to learn about the psychological mechanisms of our soul, how our body works, and the economic and social structures in which we operate. This requires us to be open-minded, willing to examine our assumptions, and adapt ourselves to new information. Instead of relying on one absolute truth, we learn to build a personal system of values, based on logic, empathy, and an understanding of the complex world we live in.

The key to a good life is having basic and pleasant living conditions. Before diving into philosophical or spiritual questions, it is worth asking simple yet fundamental questions: Am I happy with my physical condition? Does my financial situation allow me to live comfortably and securely? Am I happy with the relationships I have with my family and the people close to me? The key to a happy life is often found in positive answers to these questions.

Taking care of our health is quite trivial, and I don't think I have anything to add on this topic. The service we receive through the health funds tends to provide a solution to this issue.

Relationships and financial management are more complex topics that I feel I have more to contribute to the discussion.
